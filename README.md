# Staking reward contract

## Project Description

This project is a smart contract written in Solidity that allows users to stake Ether and earn rewards over time based on how long their Ether is staked. It's a simple DeFi mechanism intended for learning and experimentation.

## Project Vision

To offer a minimal, easy-to-understand staking and reward system to demonstrate how time-based rewards can be implemented using Ethereum smart contracts. The goal is to eventually support ERC-20 tokens, advanced reward calculations, and integration with front-end dApps.

## Key Features

- ✅ Stake Ether to earn rewards
- ✅ Time-based reward calculation
- ✅ Withdraw staked funds along with earned rewards
- ✅ Basic protection against 0-value transactions

## Future Scope

- 🔄 Support for ERC-20 tokens instead of just Ether
- 🔐 Role-based access control (e.g., for admin functions)
- 📈 Dynamic reward rates based on market conditions or governance
- 🌐 Frontend dApp integration with wallet support (e.g., MetaMask)
- 📊 Real-time analytics for staking pools
